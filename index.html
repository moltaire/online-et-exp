                <br><br><br>
                Before we begin with the study, we need to turn on and adjust your webcam for eye-tracking.<br>
                There are two parts to this process. The first part is calibration and the second part is validation.
                <br><br><br>
                During calibration, you will see a series of dots like this <span id="calibration_dot_instruction"></span> appear on the screen, each for 3 seconds.<br>
                Your task is simply to stare directly at each dot until it disappears.<br>
                Then, quickly move your eyes to the next dot and repeat.
                <br><br><br>
                Validation is basically the same as calibration. You simply need to stare at each dot until it turns <b><font color='green'>green</font></b> and disappears.<br>
                During validation, the dot may turn <b><font color='orange'>orange</font></b>, indicating that you don't seem to be staring directly at it.<br>
                Try to keep this from happening! 
                <br><br>
                When you are ready, press the SPACE BAR to continue.

                <br><br><br>
                When the calibration begins, you will see a video feed with your face at the top left corner of your screen like this: 
                <br><br><br>
                <img height="220px" width="270px" src="${et_instruct_img[0]}">
                <br><br><br>
                Try to keep your entire face within the box. When your face is in a good position, the box will turn <b><font color='green'>green</font></b>. <br>
                <font size=5px; font color = 'red';> <b>NOTE</b>: the video feed only appears during calibration.</font>

                In addition to the tips in the figure: <br>
                (1) Use your eyes to look around the screen and try to avoid moving your head. <br>
                (2) Try to keep lights in front of you rather than behind you so that the webcam can clearly see your face. Avoid sitting with a window behind you. <br>
                (3) After you have made these adjustments, check again that your face fits nicely within the box on the video feed and that the box is green. <br></div>

                Its <b>winning amount</b> is represented by a bar. The more <b><font color='ForestGreen'>green</font></b> in the bar, the higher the possible winning amount.

                In each trial, choose between the left and right lotteries, by pressing the <b>F</b> key for the left, or the <b>J</b> for the right lottery. Place your left and right index finger on these keys now.
